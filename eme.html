   <p>There are times when I just want to look at your face
    With the stars in the night
    There are times when I just want to feel your embrace
    In the cold night
    I just cant believe that you are mine now
    You were just a dream that I once knew
    I never thought I would be right for you
    I just cant compare you with anything in this world
    You're all I need to be with forevermore
    All those years, I've longed to hold you in my arms
    I've been dreaming of you
    Every night, I've been watching all the stars that fall down
    Wishing you would be mine

    I never thought I would be right for you
    I just cant compare you with anything in this world

    our love will stay together)
    You're all I need
    To be with forevermoreThere are times when I just want to look at your face
    With the stars in the night
    There are times when I just want to feel your embrace
    In the cold night
    I just cant believe that you are mine now
    You were just a dream that I once knew
    I never thought I would be right for you
    I just cant compare you with anything in this world
    You're all I need to be with forevermore
    All those years, I've longed to hold you in my arms
    I've been dreaming of you
    Every night, I've been watching all the stars that fall down
    Wishing you would be mine
    I just cant believe that you are mine now
    You were just a dream that I once knew
    I never thought I would be right for you
    I just cant compare you with anything in this world
    You're all I need to be with forevermore
    Time and again
    There are these changes that we cannot end
    As sure as time keeps going on and on
    My love for you will be forevermore
    Wishing you would be mine
    I just cant believe that you are mine now
    You were just a dream that I once knew
    I never thought I would be right for you
    I just cant compare you with anything in this world
    As endless as forever
    Our love will stay together
    You're all I need to be with forever more

    our love will stay together)
